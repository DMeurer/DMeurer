- Iâ€™m currently learning the basics of a bunch of languages. A Arduino-Robot for the Robocup in C++. A [Discord-bot](https://github.com/DMeurer/small-projects/tree/main/NodeJS/discord-bot) in Javascript. And sometimes other [small projets](https://github.com/DMeurer/small-projects) to teach myself how to code.
- My next big project is Arduino Robot for the Robocup Maze, that will use a image recognition programm in C running on a Raspberry Pi 4.
